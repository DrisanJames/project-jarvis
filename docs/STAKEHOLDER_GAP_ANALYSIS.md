| Agent Definitions | 🟡 PARTIAL | 4 agents referenced but not defined |
| Infrastructure Config | 🟡 PARTIAL | Docker configs referenced but not created |
| Test Coverage Plan | 🟡 PARTIAL | Coverage targets defined but no test inventory |
| Security | 🔴 INCOMPLETE | No security architecture documented |
| Enterprise Readiness | 🔴 INCOMPLETE | Missing compliance, DR, audit specs |

## Part 7: Stakeholder Recommendations

### For Investment Decision

1. **DO NOT PROCEED** with execution until critical gaps are remediated
2. **Allocate 15-20 additional days** for documentation completion
3. **Assign dedicated security review** before production deployment
4. **Require sign-off** from all domain experts on complete specifications

### For Execution Success

1. **Create a remediation sprint** focused solely on documentation completion
2. **Implement quality gates** that block execution on incomplete specs
3. **Establish checkpoint reviews** at each component completion
4. **Define rollback criteria** for failed quality gates

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Build in buffer time** (recommend 25% contingency)
2. **Prioritize critical path** components first
3. **Run parallel documentation** and implementation where possible
4. **Establish communication cadence** for progress reporting

## Conclusion

The current documentation provides a **strong architectural foundation** but is **not execution-ready**. With the identified remediation actions completed, the project will achieve **100% execution confidence** with **100% code coverage** targets.

**Estimated Remediation Effort:** 15-20 days  
**Recommended Next Step:** Complete critical gaps before initiating build phase
